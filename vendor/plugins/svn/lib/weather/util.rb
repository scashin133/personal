module Weather

  # Misc utility functions used by the weather library.
  # 
  # NOTE: This used to contain unit converstion routines (i.e. F to C) but
  # now we just fetch the desired unit type in the Weather.com service query,
  # so this module is left only as a placeholder for future functionality.
